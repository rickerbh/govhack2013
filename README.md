Data Source
===========
We are using the Victorian data set for [Statistical Local Area Population Projections, 2007 to 2027, Revised](http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/BDE33326FE4D5460CA2576BD00833800?OpenDocument&SUBMITCHECK=on&SUBMIT=View+documents) from [health.gov.au](http://www.health.gov.au).

The source is being split into female/male data sets, and normalised on "major" SLA name. Check the [Source Data](https://github.com/rickerbh/govhack2013/tree/master/Source%20Data) directory for this.
